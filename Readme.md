# More Realtime

Here are my slides from my talk at the NodeConf 2012.

I spoke about some of the work I've done scaling Socket.io with Redis and introduced three projects:

- [RedisStore Docs](https://github.com/dshaw/RedisStore-Docs) - Socket.io RedisStore documentation
- [Socket.io-Announce](https://github.com/dshaw/socket.io-announce) - Lightweight infrastructure broadcast for use with Socket.io RedisStore
- [Redis Monitor](https://github.com/dshaw/redis-monitor) - Realtime Redis INFO monitoring
